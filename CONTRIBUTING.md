## Some things

* This is a simple script, don't add too much to it. We don't want [feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) here.
* Do make use of the [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) file. Either manually look what indentation, etc. to use, or [use a plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) for your prefered editor (recommend).
* Before adding larger features or changing too much things, please open an issue to discuss it prior to putting work into it.
