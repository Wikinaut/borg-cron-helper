# Borg cron helper scripts
**Automate backups with borg in a more convenient and reliable way!**
These scripts are some small and handy shell scripts to automate the backup process with [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/). They are POSIX-compatible, so they should run with all shells. You're free to modify them for your needs!

They add some convienent features around borg, regarding environments with only **one client**.

The local lock system cirumvents the issue of [stale](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/813) [lock files](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/2306).

## Local lock

When the backup process is interrupted, sometimes the remote borg repository stays locked. That's why further backups will fail.

The issue [has been addressed](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/pull/1674) in borg **v1.1.0** (currently beta), but I have not tested it and until it works there, here is my workaround.

Borg's current PID is written into a file (configurable in `RUN_PID_DIR` in [`borgcron.sh`](borgcron.sh#L11)). As long as the file exists the backup is considered to be "locked". At the end of the backup process (no matter whether it was succesful or not), the local lock is being removed, permitting further backups to start. The "local lock" is more reliable than the "remote lock" system, currently implemented in stable versions of borg.
**For the system to work, the `RUN_PID_DIR` must exist and be writable.**. (If you want to comply with Linux' best practices, see [this AskUbuntu question](https://askubuntu.com/questions/303120/how-folders-created-in-var-run-on-each-reboot).)

**Attention:** As the name implies, this system assumes, that you access your borg repo in a "single-user" (one client, one server) environment. As the locking is managed locally, you should ensure, that **only one client** is allowed to access the borg repository. Otherwise **data loss may occur**, as this script automatically breaks the remote lock in the borg repository, if it is not locked locally.

**Note:** The dir, which is used for locking, (`RUN_PID_DIR`) should preferably already exist and must be writable for the process executing the backup. If not the script will fail, i.e. the backup will not be executed.  
Note that `/var/run` is often mounted as a tempfs, so all data is deleted at shutdown and you have to recreate the dirs at the (next) startup.

## Less maintenance, more safety!

Sometimes [backups stop mid-way](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#if-a-backup-stops-mid-way-does-the-already-backed-up-data-stay-there). This can have different reasons (e.g. an unreliable network). However we still want our data to be backed up.
That's why the script integrates a **retry mechanism** to retry the backup in case of a failure (for up to three times by default). Between the retry attempts the script pauses some minutes by default, to wait for your server to restart or the connection to reestablish.
This is also a workaround for the ["connection closed by remote" issue](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/636), which seems to affect some users.

Additionally the script has the ability to write stats of the last executed backup. [`cronsizecache.sh`](cronsizecache.sh) outputs the size of backups stored on the backup server. Both can be used (in conjunction with a script to check the last backup time) to **monitor your backups** and to automatically notify you, in case a backup failed/didn't work.

**Rest assured your backups are safe and recover themselve if possible.** (If they don't, you'll get to know that.)

## Modularity for multiple backups

The main "work" is done by [`borgcron.sh`](borgcron.sh).
However, for easier configuration and in order to setup multiple backup cron processes, the "configuration" and other backup/repository-specific stuff is done in the header file [`borgcron_start.sh`](borgcron_start.sh), which you can copy and rename as you want. It is also the file, which you have to start, when you want to start a backup process. (So put this into cron!)

Also, you can of course not use some features outlined here. That's why the whole functionality is broken into multiple scripts.


## Feature list
* easy to understand, easy to modify
* POSIX-compatible
* pretty logs
* passphrase can be protected better, because it's saved in an external file
* pruning after the backup
* script to dump databases before backing up
* tested in production (but no guarantees, use at your own risk! ðŸ˜‰)
* more to comeâ€¦

## What's in here?
* [`borgcron.sh`](borgcron.sh) â€“ Main "runner script". Does all stuff when a backup is triggered.
* [`borgcron_start.sh`](borgcron_start.sh) â€“ Header file with config options for a specific backup. This calls [`borgcron.sh`](borgcron.sh) internally.
* [`checklastbackup.sh`](checklastbackup.sh) â€“ Script, which you can execute at login (Add to your `.bashrc` file or so), which notifies you when a backup has failed. Otherwise it remains silent.
* [`cronsizecache.sh`](cronsizecache.sh) â€“ Small one-liner to cache the size of the dir where backups are stored. (useful for remote backup servers) You can then include the result with `cat` in your login script.
* [`databasedump.sh`](databasedump.sh) â€“ Dumps one or several databases into a dir/file. Make sure, that this script and the dump dir are only readable by your backup user. Script might have to be executed with higher privileges (i.e. root) for creating the backup.
